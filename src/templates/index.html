    <div id="prospect-app">
      <p>It has taken third baseman Josh Jung only a dozen professional games to climb to the top of our Rangers’ minor league prospect list. </p>
      <p>A big part of that is due to Jung, the Rangers’ top pick in the June draft, having a very hot start.</p>
      <p>But also: It hasn’t been a great year for those who began the season atop the prospect list.</p>
      <p>Top Rangers pitching prospects have once again been plagued by injuries. Cole Ragans, the top pick in 2016, saw his Tommy John graft fail. Owen White and Mason Englert, two of the top four picks last year, have both had Tommy John surgery this season. Taylor Hearn, who joined the list last year after being acquired from Pittsburgh, has missed almost all of the season with an elbow injury. Brocke Burke, acquired from Tampa Bay during the winter, missed much of the first half of the season with blister and shoulder issues.</p>
      <p>The most recent development: Hans Crouse, who was our top prospect for most of this season, has been limited by bone spurs behind his elbow. Though he has returned to pitching, dealing with the soreness cost him about a month. He will have the spur removed after the season.</p>
      <p>The injury issue didn’t end there. The Rangers’ top two middle infield prospects – Anderson Tejeda and Chris Seise – have both seen their seasons ended by surgery on their left (non-throwing) shoulders due to injuries suffered when diving into a base.</p>
      <p>Amid all that, there has still been growth among position players in the Rangers’ system this season. The top two picks in the draft, Texas Tech’s Jung and Baylor’s Davis Wendzel, are considered advanced hitters. Catcher Sam Huff, who won the Futures’ Game MVP with a home run, has moved into the club’s top 10. July acquisition of infielder/outfielder Nick Solak, who came from Tampa Bay, was recently ranked the No. 12 prospect in the Rangers’ system by MLB Pipeline. And you could make a case that third basemen Sherten Apostel, recently promoted from Class A Hickory to Down East, and Jonathan Ornelas, the club’s third-round pick a year ago, should be in our current top 10.</p>
      <p>For now, we’ll give the edge to young outfielders Leody Taveras and Bubba Thompson.</p>
      <p>But the rankings are getting crowded and could get more crowded still after the July 31 trade deadline.</p>
